# PyVisVue3D3: Python Module Visualization(Https://pyvisvue3d3.yingshinet.com)

## 1- How can users get started with the project?
To get started with PyVisVue3D3, simply download the source code from https://github.com/CBD-Lab/pyvis. Then install the python module needed here: flask, flask_cores, pipdeptree, requests. Other the third-party packages(such as PyTorch, torchvision, torchtext, transformers) are experiment data.
When deploying the PyVisVue3D3, users need to choose a venv, then run the main.py on port 5006. After opening Http://127.0.0.1:5006, the venv path will be displayed.

## 2- How can you extract structures of python packages in your local environment?
When clicking on ”ExtractAll,” it will extract inter-package dependencies and three types of structures within each package. This operation may take a considerable long time.

## 3- Entire Package Environment Visualization
### (1) Net json file
The default whole environment module visualization file would be called to show the relations between all packages with a force-directed graph when you open the link http://127.0.0.1:5006/.
You can input or select a package name, then the package will be displayed.  And click the LOGO[PyVIS], return to the front page.
### (2) Tree json file
Click the [tree] button to show the hierarchical tree graph of the extracted tree json file.
## 4- Single Package Visualization

### (1) Retrieval
When clicking on ”ExtractSingle”, a single package will be extracted. If there is existing data files, they will be overwritten. Afterwards, we can click on any of the 9 buttons in the top-left(shown in Fig.2) to switch among different views.

### (2) Net Layout: force-directed graph visualization
### (3) Matrix Layout: matrix diagram visualization
### (4) Class Layout: class force-directed graph visualization(only parent-children relations)
### (5) Basic Tree Layout

### (7) RadialTree Layout: radialtree visualization
### (8) Bubble Tree: bubble diagram visualization
### (9) Cloud Tree: wordcloud visualization
### (10) TreeMap Tree: treemap visualization
